# Deep-Learning-Inspired-Attendance-System

This web application is constructed using Python's web framework called Flask and demonstrates Deep learning face detection and recognition algorithms. 

The algorithms used in this project are the MTCNN face detection algorithm coupled with the ResNet-ArcFace Recognition Algorithm. 

Overall the application performs highly and works by taking pictures of the classroom and then finding all the individual faces, then recognising them by using a reference database in the system.
